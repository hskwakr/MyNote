If this is across multiple files, you may consider taking a look at sed. Use find to grab your files and xargs plus sed for a replace. Say you want to replace a with a_better_name in all files matching *.c, you could do

find . -name "*.c" | xargs sed -i -e 's/a/a_better_name/g'

Bear in mind that this will replace ALL occurrences of a, so you may want a more robust regex.
